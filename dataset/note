Summary of the project:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped us understand the distribution of heart disease cases and identify key health metrics like cholesterol and blood pressure.
Feature Engineering involved handling missing data, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for machine learning.
Random Forest, SVM, and MLP Classifier were trained to predict heart disease, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 89%.




Project Summary:
EDA: Analyzed the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Prepared the data for training by handling missing values and scaling.
Model Building: Trained and evaluated three machine learning models.
Best Model: Random Forest achieved the best accuracy for heart disease prediction.
